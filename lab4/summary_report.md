# Summary Report — Weather Data Visualizer

## Introduction
This project analyzes a 30-day weather dataset containing temperature, humidity, and rainfall values.
The purpose is to clean the data, generate basic statistics, create visual visualizations, and understand simple weather patterns.

## Dataset Description
- **Total days:** 30  
- **Columns included:**
  - `date` — date for each day  
  - `temperature` — temperature in °C  
  - `humidity` — relative humidity (%)  
  - `rainfall` — rainfall in millimeters (mm)

The dataset is clean and contains realistic sample values suitable for learning.

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Converted dates into correct datetime format.
- Sorted the weather records by date.
- Filled any missing numeric values with simple techniques (forward-fill and mean fill).

## Key Insights
- Temperatures vary naturally across the 30 days.
- Humidity ranges stay realistic and show normal day-to-day changes.
- Rainfall occurs on some days and not on others, showing mixed weather conditions.

## Visualizations Made
- A **daily temperature line graph** showing temperature trends.
- A **bar graph for rainfall** showing total rainfall across the month.
- A **scatter plot** showing the relation between humidity and temperature.
- A **combined visualization** with temperature and rainfall.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates:
- How to load and clean real-world style data.
- How to calculate summary statistics.
- How to use Python libraries to create clear and useful visualizations.

The assignment clearly shows how Python can be used to analyze and visualize weather data effectively.
